Note: I am currently am doing this on a windows computer, so some step might be different, please let me know if there are any issues
First please place all of the code doing the analyzing inside the "runner" directory
Everytime that you edit ANY of the files, you would HAVE, I repeat, you HAVE to rebuild the container

Step to use Docker
1. Download the appropriate version of docker on your machine
2. Download the code from github and save it to your local directory
3. Open up the desktop docker application
4. Check if Docker is running with the command <docker ps>
5. Navigate to directory with <cd "path/to/directory">
6. Build your docker image <docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t sandbox-dev:latest .>
4. Run <docker run -it --rm --privileged -v "%cd%":/workspace -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -w /workspace sandbox-dev:latest /bin/bash>
5. That line of code should put you into the docker container
6. In order to test package run, ./run_sandbox.sh analyze <name of package>



I will try to automate this even further so all you have to do is run a line of code which will return a true or false on whether the package is safe or not
